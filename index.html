          If you've been wanting to get into Pioneer, a great way to prepare during your decision-making and deckbuilding process is by getting a read on the local metagame. This site will give you a good idea of what you'll be up against if you play Pioneer in local events.

          Brewers have been trying to break Parhelion II (from War of the Spark) since its release -- has Greasefang, Okiba Boss brought the deck to the forefront of the Pioneer battleground?

          Jund Sacrifice decks in Pioneer have been built in two ways -- focusing on food and the "cat combo" formed by Cauldron Familiar and Witch's Oven, or by cashing in on the power of Collected Company with more value creatures and sacrifice outlets. A new build has come to town, though -- artifact tutoring with Karn and the new card from Neon Dynasty: Oni-Cult Anvil!

          Azorius Control decks have been around since the very announcement of the Pioneer format but have changed significantly over time. Do Wandering Emperor and March of Otherworldly Light have what it takes to put this deck back on top?

        There has to be this pioneer, the individual who has the courage, the ambition to overcome the obstacles that always develop when one tries to do something worthwhile, especially when it is new and different.
